# 🎉 WeCoded Celebration Landing Page

An interactive and retro-futuristic landing page to celebrate the evolution from **SheCoded** to **WeCoded**, and to highlight **diversity, inclusion, and empowerment** in the tech industry.

This project combines a nostalgic visual style with modern tech, blending the **past, present, and future** of technology. Pixel aesthetics inspired by the official WeCoded logo, vibrant color schemes, and subtle visual effects create a unique celebration of representation and innovation.

> 🔗 Built as part of the [WeCoded Challenge](https://dev.to/challenges/wecoded) by DEV Community.
